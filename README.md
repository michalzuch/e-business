## [Frontend](https://github.com/michalzuch/e-business/tree/main/Frontend)

To create a client application using the React.js library, you need to build three components: Products, Bag, and Payments. The Bag and Payments components should send data to the server application, while the Products component should download product data from the server application. The server application should be developed in one of three languages: Kotlin, Scala, or Go. All data transfers between the components should be handled using React hooks.

✅ 3.0 Create Products and Payments components | [Commit](https://github.com/michalzuch/e-business/commit/5397357845061f18854800a83e7b7f7f9879a6ba)

## [OAuth](https://github.com/michalzuch/e-business/tree/main/OAuth)

Configure the OAuth2 client. Store user data and the token on the server database. Send a new token, distinct from the provider's, to the client (React). Use the session mechanism or another suitable method. Avoid creating clients directly on the React side, excluding the server application from communication, such as using auth0.

Communication model: React - Server - Supplier - Server (via return uri) - React

## [Cloud / CI](https://github.com/michalzuch/e-business/tree/main/Cloud%20CI)

Use GitHub Actions (or other CI solutions) and the Azure cloud (or other clouds) to build and deploy a client application (frontend) and a server application (backend) as separate applications. Utilize Docker images and containers to run the applications. You can build the application in advance (as a JAR package) or build it through GitHub Actions. Consider the available cloud resources when deploying the applications.

❌ 4.0 Add e-mail notification about the application being built  
❌ 4.5 Add a step with deploying the server and client applications to the cloud
